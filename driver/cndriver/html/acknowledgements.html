<p>The version of makeself.sh used to create the .run is bundled
within the .run file, and can retrieved by extracting the .run

<p>Portions of this software are derived from third-party works
licensed under terms compatible with the above MIT license:</p>
<p>The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
src/regex/tre*) is Copyright &copy; 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and
licensed under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source
files). The included version has been heavily modified by Rich
Felker in 2012, in the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace
cleanliness.</p>
<p>Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*)
is</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2003-2011 David Schultz or</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or</p>
<p>Copyright &copy; 2008 Stephen L. Moshier</p>
<p>and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files.
All have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.</p>
<p>The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright
&copy; 2008 The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a
two-clause BSD license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on
Android.</p>
<p>The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is
Copyright &copy; 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD
license.</p>
<p>The implementation of blowfish crypt
(src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was originally written by Solar
Designer and placed into the public domain. The code also comes
with a fallback permissive license for use in jurisdictions that
may not recognize the public domain.</p>
<p>The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright
&copy; 2011 Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style
license.</p>
<p>The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed
under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was
adapted by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during
upstream integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT
terms.</p>
<p>The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and
is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard
Pennington, and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer.
It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>All other files which have no copyright comments are original
works produced specifically for use as part of this library,
written either by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or
by one or more contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of
individual files can be found in the git version control history of
the project. The omission of copyright and license comments in each
file is in the interest of source tree size.</p>
<p>In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header
files (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be
linked into applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and
arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit the copyright notice and permission
notice otherwise required by the license, and to use these files
without any requirement of attribution. These files include
substantial contributions from:</p>
<p>Bobby Bingham</p>
<p>John Spencer</p>
<p>Nicholas J. Kain</p>
<p>Rich Felker</p>
<p>Richard Pennington</p>
<p>Stefan Kristiansson</p>
<p>Szabolcs Nagy</p>
<p>all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.</p>
<p>This file previously contained text expressing a belief that
most of the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently
trivial not to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over
whether it negated the permissions granted in the license. In the
spirit of permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues
being an obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.</p>
