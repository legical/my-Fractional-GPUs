Issues</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>There are several areas in which the NVIDIA driver lacks feature
parity between X11 and Wayland. These may be due to limitations of
the driver itself, the Wayland protocol, or the specific Wayland
compositor in use. Over time this list is expected to shorten as
missing functionality is implemented both in the driver and in
upstream components, but the following captures the situation as of
the release of this driver version. Note that this assumes a
compositor with reasonably complete support for graphics-related
Wayland protocol extensions.</p>
<h3>NVIDIA Driver Limitations</h3>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>The VDPAU library (<a href="vdpausupport.html" title=
"Appendix&nbsp;G.&nbsp;VDPAU Support">Appendix&nbsp;G, <i>VDPAU
Support</i></a>), used for hardware accelerated video decoding and
presentation, does not have native Wayland support and does not
work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NvFBC desktop capture library does not have native Wayland
support and does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable display refresh rate capabilities such as G-Sync are
not reported by nvidia-drm module, therefore this functionality is
not available on Wayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual reality displays, such as the SteamVR platform, require
support for DRM display leasing which does not currently work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EGL_EXT_platform_x11 is not supported with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nvidia-drm module does not support the GAMMA_LUT,
DEGAMMA_LUT, CTM, COLOR_ENCODING, or COLOR_RANGE connector
properties, which may impact some compositor features related to
color correction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nvidia-settings configuration tool has limited functionality
on Wayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Front-buffer rendering in GLX does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Wayland Protocol or Compositor Limitations</h3>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>The following workstation features are not supported by any
Wayland compositors or the Wayland protocol. They will also likely
require new EGL extensions or other means to expose the related
hardware functionality.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="circle">
<li>
<p>SLI and Multi-GPU Mosaic (<a href="sli.html" title=
"Chapter&nbsp;31.&nbsp;Configuring SLI and Multi-GPU Mosaic">Chapter&nbsp;31,
<i>Configuring SLI and Multi-GPU Mosaic</i></a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frame Lock and Genlock (<a href="framelock.html" title=
"Chapter&nbsp;32.&nbsp;Configuring Frame Lock and Genlock">Chapter&nbsp;32,
<i>Configuring Frame Lock and Genlock</i></a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swap Groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced display pipeline features including warp and blend,
pixel shift, and emulated YUV420.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stereo rendering</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no established public API through which Wayland
compositors can power off video memory via RTD3 (<a href=
"dynamicpowermanagement.html" title=
"Chapter&nbsp;22.&nbsp;PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management">Chapter&nbsp;22,
<i>PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management</i></a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xwayland does not provide a suitable mechanism for our driver to
synchronize application rendering with presentation, which can
cause visual corruption in some circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display multiplexers (muxes) are typically used in laptops with
both integrated and discrete GPUs to provide a direct connection
between the discrete GPU and the built-in display (internal mux) or
an external display (external mux). On X11, the display mux can be
automatically switched when a full-screen application is running on
the discrete GPU, enabling enhanced display features and improved
performance, but no Wayland compositors currently support this
functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indirect GLX does not work with Xwayland because the Glamor
rendering engine is not compatible with our EGL implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware overlays cannot be used by GLX applications with
Xwayland.</p>
</li>
</ul>
