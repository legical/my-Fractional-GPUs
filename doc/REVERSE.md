# Reverse Engineering GPU L2 cache/DRAM structure

## Running reverse engineering code

We suspect that the memory hierarchy is same for all the GPUs of the same
architecture family. We base this suspicion on the fact that both GTX 1070 and GTX 1080
have the exact same memory hierarchy (based on our reverse engineering) and both belong to
Pascal architecture. We have already reversed engineering Pascal and Volta architectures,
details of which are provided below.

To reverse engineer details about other architectures, it is required to run reverse engineering code.
For this, FGPU code needs to be compiled in reverse engineering mode (See *[doc/BUILD.md](../doc/BUILD.md)*).

When reverse engineering mode is enable and FGPU is compiled, reverse engineering 
code is builded in form of a binary *gpu_reverse_engineering*, present in the build
directory. Running it provides with the details of L2 cache and DRAM structure of the current GPU. 
Refer to *[doc/PORT.md](../doc/PORT.md)* on how to run FGPU applications.

Also, some support needs to be added for that specific architecture in the device driver:
*$PROJ_DIR/driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_\<arch\>.c*

Please refer to the following files to see what changes are required:
* *[driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_pascal.c](../driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_pascal.c)*
* *[driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_volta.c](../driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_volta.c)*

After reverse engineering details about a GPU architecture, support for memory coloring can be added for that
architecture in the file $PROJ_DIR/driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_<arch>_mmu.c
We have alreeady added support for memory coloring on Pascal and Volta architecture. Please
refer to the following files:
* *[driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_pascal_mmu.c](../driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_pascal_mmu.c)*
* *[driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_volta_mmu.c](../driver/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-390.48/kernel/nvidia-uvm/uvm8_volta_mmu.c)*

## Reversed Engineered GPUs

For the following sections, we define two functions:
* **X**
    * <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X(addr, x_1, x_2 .., x_n) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n{addr[x_i]}" /></a>
    * where <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$addr[x_i]$"/></a> refers to <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_{i}^{th}"/></a> bit of <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?addr"/></a>.
    * i.e. X takes a physical address and n bit indices and returns XOR sum over all those bits of the address.
    * E.g. X(0x13, 0, 4) = 0 and X(0x13, 0, 1, 4) = 1.

* **C**
    * <a><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C(v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) = v_n\| v_{n-1}\|\dotsb\| v_1" /></a>
    * i.e. C concatenates bits together.
    * E.g. C(1, 0, 0, 0, 1) = 0x11 and C(1, 1, 0, 0, 1) = 0x13.

The following GPUs have been reversed engineered.
